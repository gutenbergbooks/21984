<h2><span class="pagebreak" title="v">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v"></a>

<a name="Introduction" id="Introduction"></a>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p>William Kemp was a comic actor of high reputation. Like Tarlton, whom he
succeeded &ldquo;as wel in the fauour of her Maiesty as in the opinion and
good thoughts of the generall audience,&rdquo;<a name="Anchor-v_1" id="Anchor-v_1"></a><a href="#Footnote-v_1" class="Footnote-num" title="Go to footnote">v:1</a> he usually played the
Clown, and was greatly applauded for his buffoonery, his extemporal
wit,<a name="Anchor-v_2" id="Anchor-v_2"></a><a href="#Footnote-v_2" class="Footnote-num" title="Go to footnote">v:2</a> and his performance of the Jig.<a name="Anchor-v_3" id="Anchor-v_3"></a><a href="#Footnote-v_3" class="Footnote-num" title="Go to footnote">v:3</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagebreak" title="vi">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi"></a>
That at one time,&mdash;perhaps from about 1589 to 1593 or later&mdash;he
belonged to a Company under the management of the celebrated Edward
Alleyn, is proved by the title-page of a drama<a name="Anchor-vi_1" id="Anchor-vi_1"></a><a href="#Footnote-vi_1" class="Footnote-num" title="Go to footnote">vi:1</a> which will be
afterwards cited. At a subsequent period he was a member of the Company
called the Lord Chamberlain&rsquo;s Servants, who played during summer at the
Globe, and during winter at the Blackfriars. In 1596, while the
last-mentioned house was undergoing considerable repair and enlargement,
a petition was presented to the Privy Council by the principal
inhabitants of the liberty, praying that the work might proceed no
further, and that theatrical exhibitions might be abolished in that
district. A counter petition, which appears to have been successful, was
presented by the Lord Chamberlain&rsquo;s Servants; and, at its commencement,
the names of the chief petitioners are thus arranged:&mdash;Thomas Pope,
Richard Burbadge, John Hemings, Augustine Phillips, William Shakespeare,
<cite>William Kempe</cite>, William Slye, and Nicholas Tooley.<a name="Anchor-vi_2" id="Anchor-vi_2"></a><a href="#Footnote-vi_2" class="Footnote-num" title="Go to footnote">vi:2</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagebreak" title="vii">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii"></a>
When <cite>Romeo and Juliet</cite> and <cite>Much ado about Nothing</cite> were originally
brought upon the stage, Kemp acted Peter and Dogberry;<a name="Anchor-vi_3" id="Anchor-vi_3"></a><a href="#Footnote-vi_3" class="Footnote-num" title="Go to footnote">vi:3</a> and it has
been supposed that in other plays of Shakespeare,&mdash;in <cite>The Two Gentlemen
of Verona</cite>, <cite>As you like it</cite>, <cite>Hamlet</cite>, <cite>The Second Part of Henry the
Fourth</cite>, and <cite>The Merchant of Venice</cite>, he performed Launce, Touchstone,
the Grave-digger, Justice Shallow, and Launcelot. On the first
production of Ben Jonson&rsquo;s <cite>Every Man in his Humour</cite>, a character<a name="Anchor-vii_1" id="Anchor-vii_1"></a><a href="#Footnote-vii_1" class="Footnote-num" title="Go to footnote">vii:1</a>
was assigned to him; and there is good reason to believe that in <cite>Every
Man out of his Humour</cite>, by the same dramatist, he represented Carlo
Buffone.</p>

<p>In 1599 Kemp attracted much attention by dancing the morris from London
to Norwich; and as well to refute the lying ballads put forth concerning
this exploit, as to testify his gratitude for the favours he had
received during his &ldquo;gambols,&rdquo;<a name="Anchor-vii_2" id="Anchor-vii_2"></a><a href="#Footnote-vii_2" class="Footnote-num" title="Go to footnote">vii:2</a> he published in the following year
the curious pamphlet which is now reprinted. A <cite>Nine daies wonder</cite> was
thus entered in the Stationers&rsquo; Books:</p>

<p>
<span class="pagebreak" title="viii">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii"></a>
Ben Jonson alludes to this remarkable journey in <cite>Every Man out of his
Humour</cite>, originally acted in 1599, where Carlo Buffone is made to
exclaim &ldquo;Would I had <em>one of Kemp&rsquo;s shoes</em> to throw after you!&rdquo;<a name="Anchor-viii_1" id="Anchor-viii_1"></a><a href="#Footnote-viii_1" class="Footnote-num" title="Go to footnote">viii:1</a>
and again in his <cite>Epigrams</cite>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">&ldquo;or which<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did dance the famous morris unto Norwich.&rdquo;<a name="Anchor-viii_2" id="Anchor-viii_2"></a><a href="#Footnote-viii_2" class="Footnote-num" title="Go to footnote">viii:2</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>So also William Rowley in the prefatory Address to a very rare tract
called <cite>A Search for Money</cite>, &amp;c., 1609, 4to.:&mdash;&ldquo;Yee haue beene either
eare or eye-witnesses or both to many madde voiages made of late yeares,
both by sea and land, as the trauell to Rome with the returne in
certaine daies, <em>the wild morrise to Norrige</em>,&rdquo; &amp;c. And Brathwait in
<cite>Remains after Death</cite>, &amp;c. 1618, 12mo. has the following lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;<em>Vpon Kempe and his morice, with his Epitaph.</em><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Welcome from Norwich, Kempe! all ioy to see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy safe returne moriscoed lustily.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But out, alasse, how soone&rsquo;s thy morice done!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Pipe and Taber, all thy friends be gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And leaue thee now to dance the second part<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With feeble nature, not with nimble Art;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Shall be? they are: th&rsquo;ast danc&rsquo;d thee out of breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now must make thy parting dance with death.&rdquo;<a name="Anchor-viii_3" id="Anchor-viii_3"></a><a href="#Footnote-viii_3" class="Footnote-num" title="Go to footnote">viii:3</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>
<span class="pagebreak" title="ix">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix"></a>
Towards the end of a <cite>Nine daies wonder</cite>, Kemp announces his intention
of setting out shortly on a &ldquo;great journey;&rdquo;<a name="Anchor-ix_1" id="Anchor-ix_1"></a><a href="#Footnote-ix_1" class="Footnote-num" title="Go to footnote">ix:1</a> but as no record of
this second feat has come down to us, we may conclude that it was never
accomplished.<a name="Anchor-ix_2" id="Anchor-ix_2"></a><a href="#Footnote-ix_2" class="Footnote-num" title="Go to footnote">ix:2</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagebreak" title="x">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x"></a>
The date of his death has not been determined. Malone, in the
uncertainty on this point, could only adduce the following passage of
Dekker&rsquo;s <cite>Guls Horne-booke</cite>, 1609, from which, he says, &ldquo;it may be
presumed&rdquo;<a name="Anchor-ix_3" id="Anchor-ix_3"></a><a href="#Footnote-ix_3" class="Footnote-num" title="Go to footnote">ix:3</a> that Kemp was then deceased: &ldquo;Tush, tush, Tarleton,
<em>Kemp</em>, nor Singer, nor all the litter of fooles that <em>now</em> come
drawling behinde them, neuer plaid the Clownes more naturally then the
arrantest Sot of you all.&rdquo;<a name="Anchor-ix_4" id="Anchor-ix_4"></a><a href="#Footnote-ix_4" class="Footnote-num" title="Go to footnote">ix:4</a> George Chalmers, however, discovered an
entry in the burial register of St. Saviour&rsquo;s, Southwark&mdash;&ldquo;1603,
November 2d <em>William Kempe, a man</em>;&rdquo;<a name="Anchor-ix_5" id="Anchor-ix_5"></a><a href="#Footnote-ix_5" class="Footnote-num" title="Go to footnote">ix:5</a> and since the name of Kemp
does not occur in the license granted by King James, 19th May, 1603, to
the Lord Chamberlain&rsquo;s Company (who in consequence of that instrument
were afterwards denominated his Majesty&rsquo;s Servants) there is great
probability that the said entry relates to the comedian, and that he had
been carried off by the plague of that year.</p>

<p>Two scenes of two early dramas, which exhibit Kemp <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">in propria persona</em>,
must necessarily form a portion of the present essay. <cite>The Retvrne from
Pernassvs: Or The Scourge of Simony. Publiquely acted by the Students in
Saint Johns Colledge in Cambridge</cite>, 1606,<a name="Anchor-x_1" id="Anchor-x_1"></a><a href="#Footnote-x_1" class="Footnote-num" title="Go to footnote">x:1</a> 4to. furnishes the first
extract:</p>

<p>When, in the former of these scenes, Kemp is said to be &ldquo;famous for

pieces which I now proceed to notice, have been erroneously attributed
to his pen.</p>

During the earlier period of the English stage, after the play was
concluded, the audience were commonly entertained by a <em>Jig</em>. As no
piece of that kind is extant, we are unable to ascertain its nature with
precision; but it appears to have been a ludicrous metrical composition,
either spoken or sung by the Clown, and occasionally accompanied by
dancing and playing on the pipe and tabor. More persons than one were
sometimes employed in a jig; and there is reason to believe that the
performance was of considerable length, occupying even the space of an
hour.<a name="Anchor-xx_1" id="Anchor-xx_1"></a><a href="#Footnote-xx_1" class="Footnote-num" title="Go to footnote">xx:1</a> The following entries are given verbatim from the

<p>These entries are quoted (imperfectly) by several antiquarian writers
who have enumerated the comedian&rsquo;s &ldquo;works;&rdquo; but his own express
declaration, which has already<a name="Anchor-xxi_3" id="Anchor-xxi_3"></a><a href="#Footnote-xxi_3" class="Footnote-num" title="Go to footnote">xxi:3</a> removed the <cite>Dvtiful Invective</cite>
from the list, can only be evaded, in the present case, by weakly
arguing&mdash;that he did not consider a Jig as a <em>pamphlet</em>, or that the
preceding entries relate to pieces which had been conveyed to the
printer without his permission. My belief is that the Jigs in question
were composed by regular dramatists, and that they were called &ldquo;Kemp&rsquo;s&rdquo;
merely because he had rendered them popular by his acting, and probably
by flashes of extemporal wit. He tells us that he had &ldquo;spent his life in
mad Jigges<a name="Anchor-xxi_4" id="Anchor-xxi_4"></a><a href="#Footnote-xxi_4" class="Footnote-num" title="Go to footnote">xxi:4</a>&rdquo;; and to one of those many entertainments Marston
alludes in <cite>The Scovrge of Villanie</cite>, 1599:</p>

<p>I may also remark, that, if Kemp had been a practised jig-maker, he
would hardly have required the assistance of a friend to furnish him

&ldquo;works.&rdquo;<a name="Anchor-xxiv_2" id="Anchor-xxiv_2"></a><a href="#Footnote-xxiv_2" class="Footnote-num" title="Go to footnote">xxiv:2</a> But surely the words of the title-page mean nothing
more than &lsquo;merriments in which Kemp had been applauded;&rsquo; and since it is
not easy to imagine that the scene, as preserved in the printed copy,
could have been received with any unusual degree of approbation even by
the rudest audience, the probability is, that he enlivened his
part,<a name="Anchor-xxv_1" id="Anchor-xxv_1"></a><a href="#Footnote-xxv_1" class="Footnote-num" title="Go to footnote">xxv:1</a> not only by his ever-welcome buffoonery, but also by sundry
speeches of extemporal humour: see a passage in <cite>The Travailes of The
three English Brothers</cite>, cited at p. xv. There can be no doubt that Kemp
figured in other &ldquo;merrimentes&rdquo; besides those &ldquo;of the men of Goteham,&rdquo;
though they have not descended to our times: &ldquo;But,&rdquo; says Nash to Gabriel
Harvey, &ldquo;by the meanes of his [Greene&rsquo;s] death thou art depriued of the
remedie in lawe which thou intendedst to haue had against him for
calling thy Father Ropemaker. Mas, thats true, what Action will it
beare? <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nihil pro nihilo</em>, none in law; what it will doe vpon the stage
I cannot tell, for there a man maye make action besides his part, when
he hath nothing at all to say: and if there, it is but a clownish action
that it will beare; for what can bee made of a Ropemaker more than a
Clowne? Will Kempe, I mistrust it will fall to thy lot for a <em>merriment</em>
one of these dayes.&rdquo; <cite>Strange Newes, Of the intercepting certaine

(attended on by <a name="P3_l10" id="P3_l10"></a><a class="endnote" title="Go to end note" href="#note_P3_l10">Thomas Slye</a> my Taberer, William Bee my seruant,

to foote it from the right honorable the Lord Mayors of London towards
the right worshipfull (and truely bountifull) Master Mayors of Norwich.</p>

<p>My setting forward was somewhat before seauen in the morning; my Taberer
stroke up merrily; and as fast as kinde peoples thronging together would
giue mee leaue, thorow London I leapt. By the way many good olde people,
and diuers others of yonger yeers, of meere kindnes gaue me bowd
sixepences and grotes, blessing me with their harty prayers and
God-speedes.</p>

Being past White-chappell, and hauing left faire London with all that
North-east Suburb before named, multitudes of Londoners left not me: but
eyther to keepe a custome which many holde, that Mile-end is no walke
without a recreati&#333; at Stratford Bow with Creame and Cakes, or else
for loue they beare toward me, or perhappes to make themselues merry if
I should chance (as many thought) to giue over my Morrice within a Mile
of Mile-end; how euer, many a thousand brought me to Bow; where I rested
a while from dancing, but had small rest with those that would haue
vrg&rsquo;d me to drinking. But, I warrant you, Will Kemp was wise enough: to
their ful cups, kinde thanks was my returne, with Gentlemanlike
protestations, as &ldquo;Truely, sir, I dare not,&rdquo; &ldquo;It stands not with the
congruity of my health.&rdquo; Congruitie, said I? how came that strange
language in my mouth? I thinke scarcely that it is any Christen worde,
and yet it may be a good worde for ought I knowe, though I neuer made
it, nor doe verye well understand it; yet I am sure I have bought it at
the word-mongers at as deare a rate as I could haue had a whole 100 of
<a name="P4_l18" id="P4_l18"></a><a class="endnote" title="Go to end note" href="#note_P4_l18">Bauines</a> at the wood-mongers. Farwell, Congruitie, for I meane now
to be more concise, and stand upon eeuener bases; but I must neither
stand nor sit, the Tabrer strikes alarum. Tickle it, good Tom, Ile
follow thee. Farwell, Bowe; haue ouer the bridge, where I heard say
honest Conscience was once drownd: its pittye if it were so; but thats
no matter belonging to our Morrice, lets now along to Stratford Langton.</p>

<p>
Many good fellows being there met, and knowing how well I loued the
sporte, had prepared a Beare-bayting; but so unreasonable were the
multitudes of people, that I could only heare the Beare roare and the
dogges howle; therefore forward I went with my <a name="P4_l30" id="P4_l30"></a><a class="endnote" title="Go to end note" href="#note_P4_l30">hey-de-gaies</a> to
Ilford, where I againe rested, and was by the people of the towne and
countrey there-about very very wel welcomed, being offred carowses in
the great spoon,<a name="Anchor-4_1" id="Anchor-4_1"></a><a href="#Footnote-4_1" class="Footnote-num" title="Go to footnote">4:1</a> one whole
<span class="pagebreak" title="5">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a>
draught being able at that time to haue
drawne my little wit drye; but being afrayde of the olde Prouerbe (He
had need of a long spoone that eates with the deuill), I soberly gaue my
boone Companyons the slip.</p>

<p>From Ilford, by Moone-shine, I set forward, dauncing within a quarter of
a myle of Romford; where, in the highway, two strong Iades (hauing
belike some great quarrell to me vnknowne) were beating and byting
either of other; and such through Gods help was my good hap, that I
escaped their hoofes, both being raysed with their fore feete ouer my
head, like two Smithes ouer an Anuyle.</p>

<p>There being the end of my first dayes Morrice, a kinde Gentleman of
London lighting from his horse, would haue no nay but I should leap into
his saddle. To be plaine with ye, I was not proud, but kindly tooke his
kindlyer offer, chiefely thereto vrg&rsquo;d by my wearines; so I rid to my
Inne at Romford.</p>

<p>In that towne, to giue rest to my well-labour&rsquo;d limbes, I continued two
dayes, being much beholding to the townsmen for their loue, but more to
the Londoners that came hourely thither in great numbers to visite me,
offring much more kindnes then I was willing to accept.</p>


<h3>The second dayes iourney, beeing Thursday of the first weeke.</h3>

<p>
Thursday being Market day at Burnt-wood, Tom Slye was earlyer up then
the Lark, and sounded merrily the Morrice: I rowsed my selfe, and
returned from Romford to the place wher I tooke horse the first night,
dauncing that quarter of a myle backe againe thorow Romford, and so
merily to Burnt-wood. Yet, now I remember it well, I had no great cause
of mirth, for at Romford townes end I strained my hip, and for a time
indured
<span class="pagebreak" title="6">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a>
exceeding paine; but being loath to trouble a Surgeon, I held
on, finding remedy by labour that had hurt mee, for it came in a turne,
and so in my daunce I turned it out of my seruice againe.</p>

<p>The multitudes were so great at my comming to Burntwood, that I had much
a doe (though I made many intreaties and staies) to get passage to my
Inne.</p>

<p>In this towne two Cut-purses were taken, that with other two of their
companions followed mee from L&#333;don (as many better disposed persons
did): but these two <a name="P6_l9" id="P6_l9"></a><a class="endnote" title="Go to end note" href="#note_P6_l9">dy-doppers</a> gaue out when they were apprehended,
that they had laid wagers and betted about my iourney; wherupon the
Officers bringing them to my Inne, I iustly denyed their acquaintance,
sauing that I remembred one of them to be <a name="P6_l13" id="P6_l13"></a><a class="endnote" title="Go to end note" href="#note_P6_l13">a noted Cut-purse, such a one
as we tye to a poast on our stage, for all people to wonder at, when at
a play they are taken pilfring</a>.</p>

<p>This fellow, and his half-brother, being found with the deed, were sent
to Iayle: their other two consorts had the charity of the towne, and
after a dance of <a name="P6_l18" id="P6_l18"></a><a class="endnote" title="Go to end note" href="#note_P6_l18">Trenchmore</a> at the whipping crosse, they were sent
backe to London, where I am afraide there are too many of their
occupation. To bee short, I thought myselfe well rid of foure such
followers, and I wish hartily that the whole world were cleer of such
<a name="P6_l22" id="P6_l22"></a><a class="endnote" title="Go to end note" href="#note_P6_l22">companions</a>.</p>

<p>Hauing rested well at Burntwood, the Moone shining clearely, and the
weather being calme, in the euening I tript it to Ingerstone, stealing
away from those numbers of people that followed mee; yet doe I what I
could, I had aboue fiftie in the company, some of London, the other of
the Country thereabout, that would needs, when they heard my Taber,
trudge after me through thicke and thin.</p>


<h3>
<span class="pagebreak" title="7">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a>
The third dayes iourney, being Friday of the first weeke.</h3>

<p>On Friday morning I set forward towardes Chelmsford, not hauing past two
hundred, being the least company that I had in the day-time betweene
London and that place. Onward I went, thus easily followed, till I come
to Witford-bridge, where a number of country people, and many Gentlemen
and Gentlewomen were gathered together to see mee. <a name="P7_l7" id="P7_l7"></a><a class="endnote" title="Go to end note" href="#note_P7_l7">Sir Thomas Mildmay,
standing at his Parke pale</a>, receiued gently a payre of garters of
me; gloues, <a name="P7_l9a" id="P7_l9a"></a><a class="endnote" title="Go to end note" href="#note_P7_l9a">points</a>, and garters, <a name="P7_l9b" id="P7_l9b"></a><a class="endnote" title="Go to end note" href="#note_P7_l9b">being my ordinary marchandize,
that I put out to venter for performance of my merry voyage</a>.</p>

<p>So much a doe I had to passe by the people at Chelmsford, that it was
more than an houre ere I could recouer my Inne gate, where I was faine
to locke my selfe in my Chamber, and pacifie them with wordes out of a
window insteed of deeds: to deale plainely, I was so weary, that I could
dance no more.</p>

<p>The next morning I footed it three myle of my way toward Braintree, but
returned backe againe to Chelmsford, where I lay that Satterday and the
next Sunday. The good cheere and kinde welcome I had at Chelmsford was
much more than I was willing to entertaine; for my onely desire was to
refraine drinke and be temperate in my dyet.</p>

<p>At Chelmsford, a Mayde not passing foureteene yeares of age, dwelling
with one Sudley, my kinde friend, made request to her Master and Dame
that she might daunce the Morrice with me in a great large roome. They
being intreated, I was soone wonne to fit her with <a name="P7_l26a" id="P7_l26a"></a><a class="endnote" title="Go to end note" href="#note_P7_l26a">bels</a>; besides
she would haue <a name="P7_l26b" id="P7_l26b"></a><a class="endnote" title="Go to end note" href="#note_P7_l26b">the olde fashion, with napking on her armes</a>; and to
our iumps we fell. A whole houre she held out; but then being ready to
lye downe I left her off; but thus much in her praise, I would haue
challenged the strongest man in Chelmsford, and amongst many I thinke
few would haue done so much.</p>


<h3>
<span class="pagebreak" title="8">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a>
The fourth dayes iourney, beeing Munday of the second weeke.</h3>

<p>On Munday morning, very early, I rid the 3 myles that I daunst the
satterday before; where alighting, my Taberer strucke up, and lightly I
tript forward; but I had the heauiest way that euer mad Morrice-dancer
trod; yet,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">With hey and ho, through thicke and thin,<br /></span>
<span class="i1"><a name="P8_l8" id="P8_l8"></a><a class="endnote" title="Go to end note" href="#note_P8_l8">The hobby horse quite forgotten</a>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I follow&rsquo;d, as I did begin,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Although the way were rotten.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This foule way I could finde no ease in, thicke woods being on eyther
side the lane; the lane likewise being full of deep holes, sometimes I
skipt vp to the waste; but it is an old Prouerb, that it is a little
comfort to the miserable to haue companions, and amidst this miry way I
had some mirth by an vnlookt for accident.</p>

<p>
It was the custome of honest Country fellows, my vnknowne friends, upon
hearing of my Pype (which might well be heard in a still morning or
euening a myle), to get vp and beare mee company a little way. In this
foule way two pretty plaine youthes watcht me, and with their kindnes
somewhat hindred me. One, a fine light fellow, would be still before me,
the other euer at my heeles. At length, comming to a broad <a name="P8_l23" id="P8_l23"></a><a class="endnote" title="Go to end note" href="#note_P8_l23">plash</a>
of water and mud, which could not be auoyded, I fetcht a rise, yet fell
in ouer the anckles at the further end. My youth that follow&rsquo;d me tooke
his iump, and stuck fast in the midst, crying out to his companion,
&ldquo;Come, George, call yee this dauncing? Ile goe no further,&rdquo; for, indeede
hee could goe no further, till his fellow was faine to wade and help him
out. I could not chuse but lough to see howe like two frogges they
laboured: a hartye farwell I gaue them, and
<span class="pagebreak" title="9">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a>
they faintly bad God speed
me, saying if I daunst that durtie way this seauen yeares againe, they
would neuer daunce after me.</p>

<p>Well, with much a doo I got unto Braintree by noone, tarried there
Munday night and the next day; onely I daunst three miles on Tewsday, to
ease my Wednesdaies iourney.</p>

<p>If I should deny that I was welcome at Braintree, I should slander an
honest crew of kind men, among whome I far&rsquo;d well, slept well, and was
euery way well usde.</p>


<h3>The fift dayes iourney, being Wednesday of the second weeke.</h3>

<p>Taking aduantage of my 3 miles that I had daunst y<sup>e</sup> day before, this
wednesday morning I tript it to Sudbury; whether came to see a very
kinde Gentleman, Master Foskew, that had before trauailed a foote from
London to Barwick, who, giuing me good counsaile to obserue temperate
dyet for my health, and other aduise to bee carefull of my company,
besides his liberall entertainment, departed, leauing me much indebted
to his loue.</p>

<p>In this towne of Sudbury there came a lusty, tall fellow, a butcher by
his profession, that would in a Morrice keepe mee company to Bury: I
being glad of his friendly offer, gaue him thankes, and forward wee did
set; but ere euer wee had measur&rsquo;d halfe a mile of our way, he gaue me
ouer in the plain field, protesting, that if he might get a 100 pound,
he would not hold out with me; for indeed my pace in dauncing is not
ordinary.</p>

<p>
As he and I were parting, a lusty Country lasse being among the people,
cal&rsquo;d him faint hearted lout, saying, &ldquo;If I had begun to daunce, I would
haue held out one myle though it had cost my life.&rdquo; At which wordes many
laughed. &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; saith she, &ldquo;if the Dauncer will lend me a leash of his
belles, Ile venter to treade one mile with him my selfe.&rdquo; I lookt vpon
her, saw mirth in her eies, heard boldnes in her words, and beheld her
<span class="pagebreak" title="10">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a>
ready to tucke vp her russet petticoate; I fitted her with bels, which
[s]he merrily taking, garnisht her thicke short legs, and with a smooth
brow bad the Tabrer begin. The Drum strucke; forward marcht I with my
merry Maydemarian, who shooke her fat sides, and footed it merrily to
Melfoord, being a long myle. There parting with her, I gaue her (besides
her skinfull of drinke) an English crowne to buy more drinke; for, good
wench, she was in a pittious heate: my kindnes she requited with
dropping some dozen of short courtsies, and bidding God blesse the
Dauncer. I bad her adieu; and to giue her her due, she had a good eare,
daunst truely, and wee parted friendly. But ere I part with her, a good
fellow, my friend, hauin writ an odde Rime of her, I will make bolde to
set it downe.</p>

<p>
At Melford diuers Gentlemen met mee, who brought me to one Master
Colts, a very kinde and worshipfull Gentleman, where I had vnexpected
entertainment till the Satterday. From whose
<span class="pagebreak" title="11">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a>
house, hauing hope somewhat
to amend my way to Bury, I determined to goe by Clare, but I found it to
be both farther and fouler.</p>


<h3>The sixt dayes iourney, being Satterday of the second weeke.</h3>

<p>From Wednesday night til Satterday hauing bin very troublesome but much
more welcome to master Colts, in the morning I tooke my leaue, and was
accompanied with many Gentlemen a myle of my way. Which myle master
Colts his foole would needs daunce with me, and had his desire, where
leauing me, two fooles parted faire in a foule way; I keeping on my
course to Clare, where I a while rested, and then cheerefully set
forward to Bury.</p>

<p>Passing from Clare towards Bury, I was inuited to the house of a very
bountifull widdow, whose husband during his life was a Yeoman of that
Countrie; dying rich no doubt, as might well appeare, by the riches and
plentie that abounded in euery corner of the house. She is called the
widdow Eueret.</p>

<p>At her house were met aboue thirty Gentlemen. Such, and so plentifull
variety of good fare I haue very sildome seene in any Commoners house.
Her behauiour being very modest and freendly, argued her bringing vp not
to be rude. She was a woman of good presence, and, if a foole may iudge,
of no smal discretion.</p>

<p>From this widdowes I daunst to Bury, comming in on the Satterday in the
afternoone, at what time the right Honorable <a name="P11_l25" id="P11_l25"></a><a class="endnote" title="Go to end note" href="#note_P11_l25">the Lord Chiefe
Justice</a> entred at an other gate of the towne. The wondring and
regardles multitude making his honor cleere way, left the streetes where
he past to gape at me; the throng of them being so great that poore Will
Kemp was seauen times stayed ere hee could recouer his Inne. By reason
of the great snow that then fell, I stayd at Bury from Satterday in the
second week of my setting foorth til Thursday night the next weeke
following.</p>


<h3>
<span class="pagebreak" title="12">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a>
The seauenth dayes iourney, being Friday of the third weeke.</h3>

<p>Vpon Fryday morning I set on towardes Thetford, dauncing that tenne mile
in three houres; for I left Bury somewhat after seauen in the morning,
and was at Thetford somewhat after ten that same forenoone. But, indeed,
considering how I had been booted the other iourneys before, and that
all this way, or the most of it, was ouer a heath, it was no great
wonder; for I far&rsquo;d like one that had escaped the stockes, and tride the
vse of his legs to out-run the Constable: so light was my heeles, that I
counted the ten mile no better than a leape.</p>

<p>At my entrance into Thetford the people came in great numbers to see
mee; for there were many there, being Size time. The noble Gentleman,
<a name="P12_l13" id="P12_l13"></a><a class="endnote" title="Go to end note" href="#note_P12_l13">Sir Edwin Rich</a>, gaue me entertainment in such bountifull and
liberal sort, during my continuance there Satterday and Sunday, that I
want fitte words to expresse the least part of his worthy vsage of my
vnworthines; and to conclude liberally as hee had begun and continued,
at my departure on Munday his worship gaue me fiue pound.</p>


<h3>The eyght dayes iourney, being Munday of the fourth weeke.</h3>

<p>On Munday morning I daunst to Rockland ere I rested, and comming to my
Inne, where the Hoast was a very boone companion, I desired to see him;
but in no case he would be spoken with till he had shifted himselfe from
his working dayes sute. Being armed at all poyntes, from the cap to the
codpeece, his blacke shooes shining and made straght with copper buckles
of the best, his garters in the fashion, and euery garment fitting
Corremsquandam (to use his owne word), hee enters the Hall, with his
bonnet in his hand, began to crye out:</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O Kemp, deere Master Kemp! you are euen as welcome
<span class="pagebreak" title="13">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a>
as&mdash;as&mdash;as&mdash;,&rdquo; and
so stammering he began to study for a fit comparison, and, I thanke him,
at last he fitted me; for saith he, &ldquo;thou art euen as welcome as the
Queenes best grey-hound.&rdquo; After this dogged yet well-meaning salutation,
the Carrowses were called in; and my friendly Hoast of Rockland <a name="P13_l5" id="P13_l5"></a><a class="endnote" title="Go to end note" href="#note_P13_l5">began
withall this, blessing</a> the houre vppon his knees, that any of the
Queenes Maiesties well-willers or friends would vouchsafe to come within
his house; as if neuer any such had been within his doores before.</p>

<p>I tooke his good meaning, and gaue him great thankes for his kindenesse;
and hauing rested mee well, began to take my course for Hingham, whether
my honest Hoast of Rockland would needs be my guide: but, good true
fat-belly, he had not followed mee two fieldes, but he lyes all along,
and cryes after me to come backe and speake with him. I fulfild his
request: and comming to him, &ldquo;Dauncer,&rdquo; quoth hee, &ldquo;if thou daunce a
Gods name, God speede thee! I cannot follow thee a foote farther; but
adieu, good dauncer; God speed thee, if thou daunce a Gods name!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I, hauing haste of my way, and he being able to keep no way, there wee
parted. Farewell he: he was a kinde good fellow, a true Troyan; and if
euer be my lucke to meete him at more leasure, Ile make him full amendes
with a Cup full of Canarie. But nowe I am a little better aduis&rsquo;d, wee
must not thus let my madde Hoast passe; for my friend, late mentioned
before, that made the odde rime on my Maide-marian, would needes
remember my Hoast. Such as it is, He bluntly set downe.</p>

<p>Well, once againe farewell mine Hoast at Rockland. After all these
farewels, I am sure to Hingham I found a foule way, as before I had done
from Thetford to Rockland.</p>

<p>
Yet, besides the deep way, I was much hindred by the desire people had
to see me. For euen as our Shop-keepers will hayle and pull a man with
&ldquo;<a name="P14_l27" id="P14_l27"></a><a class="endnote" title="Go to end note" href="#note_P14_l27">Lack ye? what do you lack, Gentlemen?</a>&rdquo; &ldquo;My ware is best,&rdquo; cryes
one, &ldquo;Mine best in England,&rdquo; sayes an other, &ldquo;Heere shall you haue
choyse,&rdquo; saith the third; so was the dyuers voyces of the young men and
Maydens, which I should meete at euerie myles ende, thronging by
twentie, and sometime fortie, yea, hundreths in a companie; one crying
&ldquo;The fayrest way was thorow their Village,&rdquo; another, &ldquo;This is the
nearest and
<span class="pagebreak" title="15">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a>
fayrest way, when you haue past but a myle and a halfe;&rdquo; an
other <a name="P15_l2" id="P15_l2"></a><a class="endnote" title="Go to end note" href="#note_P15_l2">sort</a> crie &ldquo;Turne on the left hand,&rdquo; some &ldquo;On the right
hand;&rdquo; that I was so amazed I knewe not sometime which way I might best
take; but haphazard, the people still accompanying me, wherewith I was
much comforted, though the wayes were badde; but as I said before at
last I ouertooke it.</p>


<h3>The ninth dayes iourney, being Wednesday of the second weeke.</h3>

<p>The next morning I left Hingham, not staying till I came to
Barford-bridge, fiue young men running all the way with me, for
otherwise my pace was not for footemen.</p>

<p>From Barford bridge I daunst to Norwich; but comming within sight of the
Citty, perceiuing so great a multitude and throng of people still
crowding more and more about me, mistrusting it would be a <a name="P15_l15" id="P15_l15"></a><a class="endnote" title="Go to end note" href="#note_P15_l15">let</a> to
my determined expedition and pleasurable humour, which I long before
conceiued to delight this Citty with (so far as my best skill and
industry of my long trauelled sinewes could affoord them), I was
aduised, and so tooke ease by that aduise, to stay my Morrice a little
aboue Saint Giles his gate, where I tooke my gelding, and so rid into
the Citty, procrastinating my merry Morrice daunce through the Citty
till better opportunitie.</p>

<p>Being come into the Citty, <a name="P15_l23" id="P15_l23"></a><a class="endnote" title="Go to end note" href="#note_P15_l23">Master Roger Wiler the Maior</a>, and
sundry other of his worshipfull Brethren, sent for me; who perceiuing
howe I intended not to daunce into the Cittye that nyght, and being well
satisfied with the reasons, they allotted me time enough not to daunce
in till Satterday after; to the end that diuers knights and Gentlemen,
together with their wiues and children (who had beene many dayes before
deceyued with expectation of my comming), might nowe haue sufficient
warning accordingly by satterday following.</p>

<p>
In the meane space, and during my still continuaunce in the
<span class="pagebreak" title="16">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a>
Cittye
afterwardes, they not onely very courteously offered to beare mine owne
charges and my followers, but very bountifully performed it at the
common charges: the Mayor and many of the Aldermen often times besides
inuited vs priuately to theyr seuerall houses.</p>

<p>To make a short end of this tedious description of my entertainment;
Satterday no sooner came but I returned without the Citty through Saint
Giles his gate, and beganne my Morrice where I left at that gate, but I
entred in at Saint Stephens gate, where one Thomas Gilbert in name of
all the rest of the Cittizens gaue me a friendly and exceeding kind
welcome; which I haue no reason to omit, vnlesse I would condemne my
selfe of ingratitude, partlye for the priuate affection of the writer
towardes me, as also for the generall loue and fauour I found in them
from the highest to the lowest, the richest as the poorest. It followes
in these few lynes.</p>

Passing the gate, <a name="P17_l1" id="P17_l1"></a><a class="endnote" title="Go to end note" href="#note_P17_l1">Wifflers</a> (such Officers as were appointed by
the Mayor) to make me way through the throng of the people which prest
so mightily vpon me, with great labour I got thorow that narrow
<a name="P17_l4" id="P17_l4"></a><a class="endnote" title="Go to end note" href="#note_P17_l4">preaze</a> into the open market place; where on the crosse, ready
prepared, stood the Citty Waytes, which not a little refreshed my
wearines with toyling thorow so narrow a lane as the people left me:
such Waytes (under Benedicite be it spoken) fewe Citties in our Realme
haue the like, none better; who, besides their excellency in wind
instruments, their rare cunning on the Vyoll and Violin, theyr voices be
admirable, euerie one of th&#275; able to serue in any Cathedrall Church
in Christendoome for Quiristers.</p>

<p>
Passing by the Market place, the presse still increasing by the number
of boyes, girles, men and women, thronging more and more before me to
see the end; it was the mischaunce of a homely maide, that, belike, was
but newly crept into the fashion of long wasted peticotes tyde with
<a name="P17_l17" id="P17_l17"></a><a class="endnote" title="Go to end note" href="#note_P17_l17">points</a>, and had, as it seemed, but one point tyed before, and
comming vnluckily in my way, as I was fetching a leape, it fell out that
I set my foote on her skirts: the point eyther breaking or stretching,
off fell her peticoate from her waste, but as chance was, thogh hir
smock were course, it was cleanely; yet the poore wench was so ashamed,
the rather for that she could hardly recouer her coate againe from
vnruly boies, that looking before like one that had the greene
sicknesse, now had she her cheekes all coloured with scarlet. I was
sorry for her, but on I went towards the Maiors, and deceiued the people
by leaping ouer the church-yard wall at S. Johns, getting so into M.
Mayors gates a neerer way; but at last I found it the further way about,
being forced on the Tewsday following to renew my former daunce, because
George Sprat, my ouer-seer, hauing lost me in the throng, would not be
deposed that I had daunst it, since he saw me not; and I must confesse I
did not wel, for the Cittizens had caused all the turne-pikes to be
taken
<span class="pagebreak" title="18">&nbsp;</span><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a>
vp on Satterday that I might not bee hindred. But now I returne
againe to <a name="P18_l2" id="P18_l2"></a><a class="endnote" title="Go to end note" href="#note_P18_l2">my Jump, the measure of which is to be seene in the Guild-hall
at Norwich,</a> where my buskins, that I then wore and daunst in from
London thither, stand equally deuided, nailde on the wall. The plenty of
good cheere at the Mayors, his bounty and kinde vsage, together with the
general welcomes of his worshipful brethren, and many other knights,
Ladies, Gentlemen and Gentlewomen, so much exceeded my expectation, as I
adiudg&rsquo;d my selfe most bound to them all. The Maior gaue me fiue pound
in Elizabeth <a name="P18_l10" id="P18_l10"></a><a class="endnote" title="Go to end note" href="#note_P18_l10">angels</a>; which Maior (faire Madame, to whom I too
presumptuously dedicate my idle paces) <a name="P18_l11" id="P18_l11"></a><a class="endnote" title="Go to end note" href="#note_P18_l11">is a man</a> worthy of a

vnmarried, and childlesse; neuer purrchased house nor land, the house he
dwels in this yeere being but hyred: he liues vpon marchandies, being a
Marchant venturer. If our marchants and gentlemen wold take example by
this man, Gentlemen would not sell their lands to become banckrout
Marchants, nor Marchants liue in the possessions of youth-beguiled

<p>
Pardon me, Madame, that I am thus tedious; I cannot chuse but c&#333;mend
sacred liberality, which makes poore wretches partakers of all
comfortable benefits: besides the loue and fauour already repeated, <a name="P18_l30" id="P18_l30"></a><a class="endnote" title="Go to end note" href="#note_P18_l30">M.

terrible accusation to his charge. He swels presently, like one of the
foure windes; the violence of his breath blew the Tobacco out of the

a deposit in money: but we learn from a passage towards the end of the
tract (p. 19), that our Morrice-dancer had also &ldquo;put out some money to

those who undertook expeditions to put out sums of money on condition of
receiving them back trebled, quadrupled, or quintupled, at the

morris-dancers amounted from twenty to forty. They had various
appellations, as the fore-bell, the second bell, the treble, the tenor,
the base, and the double-bell. Sometimes they used trebles only; but
these refinements were of later times. The bells were occasionally
jingled by the hands, or placed on the arms or wrists of the
parties.&rdquo;&mdash;Douce&rsquo;s <cite>Illust. of Shakespeare</cite>, ii. 475. The same writer
mentions that in the time of Henry the Eighth the Morris-dancers had

London, he would have been punished for writing &ldquo;a certain Ballad,

player, an apprentice to Allde the printer, a retainer of the Earl of
Oxford, a Messenger of her Majesty&rsquo;s Chamber, Poet to the City,
dramatist, writer in verse and prose, and draper. He also excited
considerable attention, and drew much trouble on himself, by his efforts

Street, he died in his 80th year, August 10th 1633. (Stow&rsquo;s <cite>Survey</cite>, B.

Gifford thinks it probable that most of the annual pageants from 1591
to the death of Elizabeth were produced by Munday (Note on B. Jonson&rsquo;s
<cite>Works</cite>, vi. 328). Though Kemp declares here that his &ldquo;imployment for
the pageant was utterly spent,&rdquo; yet Anthony furnished the city shows for
1605, 1611, and (in spite of an attack made on him by Middleton in
1613&mdash;see my ed. of Middleton&rsquo;s <cite>Works</cite>, v. 219, note), for 1614, 1615,
and 1616.</p>

<p>Except a &ldquo;Song of Robin Hood and his Huntesmen&rdquo; in <cite>Metropolis
Coronata</cite>, I am not aware that any of Munday&rsquo;s ballads are
extant&mdash;unless indeed the &ldquo;ditties&rdquo; in <cite>The Banquet of daintie Conceits</cite>
may be regarded as such; but there is no doubt that they were numerous,
and hence, in the present passage, he is termed the &ldquo;immediate heyre&rdquo; of
William Elderton. This personage,&mdash;who is said to have been, at
different periods of his life, an actor, the master of a company of
players, and an attorney in the Sheriff&rsquo;s Court, London,&mdash;obtained great
notoriety by his ballads. See a list of his pieces in Ritson&rsquo;s <cite>Bibl.
Poet.</cite>: vide also Warton&rsquo;s <cite>Hist. of Engl. Poet.</cite> iv. 40, ed. 4to. His
song &ldquo;The God of love,&rdquo; &amp;c. (of which a puritanical moralization still
exists) is quoted in Shakespeare&rsquo;s <cite>Much ado about Nothing</cite>, act v. sc.
2. His <cite>Verses on the Images over the Guild-hall Gate</cite> may be read in
Stow&rsquo;s <cite>Survey</cite>, B. iii. 41, ed. 1720; his ballad of <cite>The King of Scots
and Andrew Browne</cite>, in Percy&rsquo;s <cite>Rel. of An. Engl. Poet.</cite> ii. 207, ed.
1794; his <cite>New Yorkshyre Song</cite>, in Evans&rsquo;s <cite>Old Ballads</cite>, i. 20, ed.

upon Henry Earl of Arundel</cite>, in <cite>The Harl. Miscell.</cite> X. 267, <em>seq.</em> ed.
Park. Elderton appears to have ceased pouring forth his doggrel about
the time that Deloney began to write. In 1592 he was dead: see Nash&rsquo;s
<cite>Strange Newes, Of the intercepting certaine Letters</cite>, &amp;c., 1592, Sig.
D. 4. He was nearly as famous for drinking as for rhyming: of two
epitaphs on him, preserved by Camden, I subjoin the first:</p>
